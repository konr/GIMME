;;; Commentary

;; Fancy functions that improve GIMME with data that is not available
;; in your computer. Freebase, Libre.fm, Lyrics support: all of these
;; should go here, although as of GIMME 2, they are not much than
;; interfaces, as the functionality is implemented in Ruby.

;; Notice that some of these functions are not bound, and I don't know
;; if they should be.
